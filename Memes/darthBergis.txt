Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Bergis The Productive? 
I thought not. It’s not a story the MMEs would tell you. It’s an ECE legend. 
Darth Bergis was a Dark Lord of the ECE, so productive and so wise he could use the copper to influence the electrons to create logic...
He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from slacking. 
The dark side of engineering is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. 
He became so productive... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his motivation, which eventually, of course, he did. 
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice turned off his alarm clock in his sleep.
Ironic. He could save others from slacking, but not himself.
